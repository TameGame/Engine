TameGame is a 2D game engine written in JavaScript. It's built to be modular and to
stay out of the way whenever it can, while still being as helpful as possible. It runs
in modern browsers that support WebGL and WebWorkers.

TameGame's modular design means that it's possible to use as much or as little of
the functionality it provides as required for any project and easily replace any
behaviour as required.
